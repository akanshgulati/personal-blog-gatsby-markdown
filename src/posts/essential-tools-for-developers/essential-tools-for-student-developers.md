The world has changed and almost all established organisations are promoting their tools and services for 
free to students so that they can play with it, have hands-on experience and pay once the basic set of 
free features are not filling their requirements. Due to limited resources and lack of personal earnings, 
studenthood mainly looks for free software and this post is regarding the essential tools and service which a 
developer student might need in course of learning web development, machine learning, networking, etc. 
Not only this, you can easily host your portfolio which will help you in job applications.
